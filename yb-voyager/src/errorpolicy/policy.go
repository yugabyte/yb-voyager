/*
ErrorPolicy defines what to do when an error occurs during a task.
Currently, it is used in the context of import-data, where we do the following tasks:
1. Read the data from the source
2. Transform the data
3. Write the data to the target
If an error occurs during any of these tasks related to data specifically, a policy will
determine what needs to be done.
